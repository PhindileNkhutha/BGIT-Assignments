        while
        now.I started self teaching in 2021 but i always wished i got accepted into a bootcamp so that i can be able
        to
        understand what i didn't understand while self-teaching.Im glad i got accepted into the <span>BGIT Frontend
          Bootcamp.</span> I am a mother to two beautiful girls and im working very hard to make sure i set a good
        example
        to them. I want my daughters to be so proud of their momma! </p>
      <p>I believe my passion and determination will see me through, i am closer to breaking into Tech that i was in
        2021.
        I am so motivated to be undertaking this journey with other black women that are also having the same goal as
        mine,to bridge the gender gap in the tech space! </p>
