Assignment Title: Simple Webpage Styling with CSS

Objective: In this assignment, you will create a simple webpage and apply CSS styles to
enhance its visual appearance. You will practise styling headings, paragraphs, and images
using both internal and external CSS methods.

Instructions:

Create the HTML Structure:
Create a new HTML file named "index.html."

Build a simple webpage with the following elements:
A heading (h1) with the title of your webpage.
A paragraph (p) introducing yourself or a topic of your choice.
An image (img) representing your personal or fictional portfolio.

Internal CSS Styling:
Inside the "head" section of your "index.html" file, add a "style" block.

Use CSS to style the elements in your webpage:
Customise the font family, size, colour, and alignment for headings (h1).
Style the paragraph (p) with a different font family, size, line height, and colour.
Adjust the size and alignment of the image (img) using CSS properties.
External CSS Styling:
Create a new CSS file named "styles.css" in the same folder as your "index.html."
Link the "styles.css" file to your "index.html" using an external link.
Move the CSS styles from the internal "style" block to the "styles.css" file.
Ensure that the webpage looks the same after moving the styles to the external CSS file.
Apply Different Styles:
Experiment with different CSS properties and values to enhance the visual appeal of your
webpage.
Use color, font styles, margins, paddings, and borders to make your webpage visually
appealing.
Additional Notes:
Use proper indentation and comments in your CSS code to improve readability.
Make sure the webpage is responsive and displays well on different screen sizes (e.g.,
desktop, tablet, mobile).
Feel free to use placeholder text and images if you prefer not to include personal information
or images.
The focus of this assignment is on applying CSS styles creatively and effectively. Don't
hesitate to experiment and have fun with your design!
