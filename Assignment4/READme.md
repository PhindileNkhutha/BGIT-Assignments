Requirements:
1. Create a Task class with the following properties:
● id (a unique identifier for each task)
● description (a description of the task)
● completed (a boolean indicating whether the task is completed or not)
2. Create a TaskManager class with the following methods:
● addTask(description) - Adds a new task to the task manager. The task should
have a unique ID.
● completeTask(id) - Marks a task as completed based on its ID.
● getCompletedTasks() - Returns an array of completed tasks.
● Ensure that all tasks are stored asynchronously (you can use setTimeout or
Promise to simulate asynchronous behavior).

3. Create an instance of the TaskManager class and demonstrate the usage of the
methods.
Guidelines:
● Use classes and appropriate object-oriented programming principles.
● Simulate asynchronous behavior using setTimeout or Promise.
● Ensure that tasks have unique IDs.
● Test the functionality of your TaskManager class by adding tasks, marking tasks as
completed, and retrieving completed tasks.
● Provide comments explaining your code.
