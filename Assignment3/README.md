Assignment: Responsive Food Recipe Website
Objective:
Create a responsive food recipe website with a minimum of three pages using HTML and
CSS. The website should include hyperlinks to showcase different areas of the site or links
to external websites/resources related to food and recipes.
Requirements:
Home Page (index.html):
● Include a welcome message or introduction to the website.
● Display a featured recipe with an image, title, and a brief description.
● Provide a "View Recipe" button that links to the detailed recipe page.
● Add a navigation menu with hyperlinks to other pages (e.g., Recipes, About Us).
Recipes Page (recipes.html):
● List at least three different recipes with images, titles, and a brief description.
● Each recipe should have a "Read More" button that links to its detailed recipe page.
● Include a navigation menu to easily navigate between pages.
● Optionally, add links to external recipe websites or resources for additional
inspiration.
Detailed Recipe Pages (recipe1.html, recipe2.html, recipe3.html):
● Each detailed recipe page should provide step-by-step instructions, ingredients, and
cooking time.
● Include a prominent image of the completed dish.
● Add a "Back to Recipes" button that links back to the Recipes page.
● Optionally, include links to related recipes or external resources (e.g., ingredient
suppliers).
About Us Page (about.html):
● Share information about the creators of the website or the imaginary chefs behind the
recipes.
● Include images, short bios, and any interesting details about the team.
● Provide a "Back to Home" button for easy navigation.
Design Considerations:
● Implement a responsive design to ensure the website looks good on both desktop
and mobile devices.
● Use CSS styling for consistent and visually appealing layouts.
● Consider using Flexbox or CSS Grid to structure the page layouts.
● Apply proper indentation and commenting in your HTML and CSS code for clarity.
